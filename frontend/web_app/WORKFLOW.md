# Team Collaboration Workflow Guide

## 🎯 Project Overview
This web application has 4 main sections that need to be developed collaboratively:
- **Home**: Dashboard and overview
- **Report**: Incident reporting functionality  
- **Community**: Social features and community interaction
- **Profile**: User management and settings

## 👥 Team Structure & Responsibilities

### Developer 1: Home & Report
**Primary Focus**: Core functionality and reporting system
- `src/pages/Home/` - Dashboard, stats, recent activity
- `src/pages/Report/` - Form handling, file uploads, validation
- Report-related API services in `src/services/`
- Home dashboard components

### Developer 2: Community & Profile  
**Primary Focus**: Social features and user management
- `src/pages/Community/` - Feed, posts, groups, interactions
- `src/pages/Profile/` - User settings, activity history, achievements
- Community-related API services in `src/services/`
- Profile management components

### Shared Responsibilities
Both developers contribute to:
- `src/components/shared/` - Reusable UI components
- `src/components/Layout/` - Navigation and layout
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions and helpers
- `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks

## 🌿 Git Workflow

### Branch Structure
```
main                    # Production code (protected)
├── develop            # Integration branch (protected)
├── feature/home       # Home page development
├── feature/report     # Report functionality
├── feature/community  # Community features
├── feature/profile    # Profile features
├── feature/shared     # Shared components
└── hotfix/*          # Emergency fixes
```

### Daily Workflow

#### 1. Start of Day
```bash
# Switch to develop and pull latest changes
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create or switch to your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-section-name
# OR
git checkout feature/your-section-name
git rebase develop  # Keep your branch up to date
```

#### 2. During Development
```bash
# Make frequent, small commits
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add report form validation"

# Push regularly to backup your work
git push origin feature/your-section-name
```

#### 3. End of Day / Feature Complete
```bash
# Final push
git push origin feature/your-section-name

# Create Pull Request to develop branch
# - Add clear title and description
# - Tag your teammate for review
# - Include screenshots if UI changes
```

### Commit Message Convention
```
feat: add new feature
fix: bug fix
docs: documentation changes
style: formatting, missing semicolons, etc
refactor: code restructuring
test: adding tests
chore: maintenance tasks
```

## 🔄 Integration Process

### Before Starting New Work
1. **Sync with develop**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   ```

2. **Check for conflicts early**
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/your-branch
   git rebase develop
   ```

3. **Review shared components**
   - Check `src/components/shared/` for existing components
   - Review `src/utils/constants.js` for shared constants
   - Look at `src/utils/api.js` for API patterns

### Pull Request Guidelines

#### PR Title Format
- `feat(home): add dashboard statistics`
- `fix(report): resolve form validation issue`
- `refactor(shared): improve button component`

#### PR Description Template
```markdown

## Notes for Reviewer
Any specific areas to focus on during review
```

### Code Review Process
1. **Reviewer checks:**
   - Code follows project structure
   - No breaking changes to shared components
   - Proper error handling
   - Responsive design
   - Performance considerations

2. **Author responsibilities:**
   - Address all feedback
   - Test thoroughly before requesting review
   - Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized

## 🛠️ Development Standards

### File Organization
```
src/pages/YourSection/
├── YourSection.jsx           # Main page component
├── components/               # Section-specific components
│   ├── SectionSpecific.jsx
│   └── AnotherComponent.jsx
├── hooks/                    # Section-specific hooks
│   └── useSectionData.js
├── utils/                    # Section-specific utilities
│   └── sectionHelpers.js
└── index.js                  # Export file
```

### Component Guidelines
1. **Keep components small** - Single responsibility
2. **Use shared components** - Check `components/shared/` first
3. **Consistent naming** - PascalCase for components
4. **PropTypes** - Define prop types for reusability
5. **Error boundaries** - Handle errors gracefully

### API Integration
```javascript
// Use the shared API utility
import api from '../utils/api';
import { API_ENDPOINTS } from '../utils/constants';

// Example service function
export const createReport = async (reportData) => {
  try {
    const response = await api.post(API_ENDPOINTS.REPORTS.CREATE, reportData);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(error.response?.data?.message || 'Failed to create report');
  }
};
```

### Styling Guidelines
1. **Tailwind CSS** - Use utility classes
2. **Responsive design** - Mobile-first approach
3. **Consistent spacing** - Use Tailwind spacing scale
4. **Color scheme** - Follow design system colors
5. **Dark mode ready** - Consider dark mode variants

## 🚨 Conflict Resolution

### Common Conflict Scenarios
1. **Both editing same shared component**
   - Communicate before making changes
   - Create separate PR for shared component updates
   - Coordinate timing of merges

2. **API endpoint changes**
   - Update `src/utils/constants.js` first
   - Notify team of API changes
   - Update documentation

3. **Routing conflicts**
   - Coordinate route definitions
   - Update `src/App.jsx` together
   - Test navigation thoroughly

### Merge Conflict Resolution
```bash
# When you encounter conflicts during rebase
git status                    # See conflicted files
# Edit files to resolve conflicts
git add .                     # Stage resolved files
git rebase --continue         # Continue rebase

# If rebase gets too complex
git rebase --abort           # Start over
# Ask teammate for help with complex conflicts
```

## 📋 Daily Standup Format

### What to Share
1. **Yesterday**: What you completed
2. **Today**: What you're working on
3. **Blockers**: Any issues or dependencies
4. **Coordination**: Any shared component needs

### Example Update

- Waiting for design feedback on error states

Coordination:
- Planning to update shared Input component - will create separate PR
```
